Most of my waking hours are spent writing dart code :dart:, and rust is nice too ðŸ¦€

Interests:
- â™™ chess and variants
- :notes: generative audio
- :book: language learning

My open source dart packages:

### [Bishop](https://github.com/alexobviously/bishop)
Chess logic package with flexible variant support written in pure dart.  
Supports a wide variety of two player board games and makes it easy to define your own.

### [Squares](https://github.com/alexobviously/squares)
Versatile chessboard UI for flutter, offering a wide range of customisation options.  
Also plays nice with Bishop.

### [Secretary](https://github.com/alexobviously/secretary)
A sophisticated tool for managing queues of asynchronous tasks, with a stream interface, strong typing and lots of helpful options. 

### [Nice JSON](https://github.com/alexobviously/nice_json)
A nice way to encode nice maps into nice-looking json. 

### [Cachette](https://github.com/alexobviously/cachette)
A simple and elegant in-memory cache.
